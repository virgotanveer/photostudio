## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid purple (#9F5FBC) for a creative, modern, and slightly edgy feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F5), a very desaturated near-white hue from the same purple family, creates a neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Lavender (#D1B0FF), which is analogous to purple (slightly 'left' of it on the color wheel) and adds a gentle highlight without overpowering the design.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, providing a geometric and contemporary feel, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, offering a balance of modernity and readability.
- Code Font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use clean, minimalist icons with a touch of modernity to represent various photo editing functions.
- Design a clean, step-by-step workflow interface (upload -> edit -> enhance -> export) with drag-and-drop support and real-time preview.
- Subtle, smooth animations for transitions and feedback to enhance the user experience.
